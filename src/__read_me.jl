# The examples presented in the manuscript are comprised in folder __EXAMPLES 
# They create the variables:
# xx_train -> x in manuscript 
# yy_train -> y 
# i_train  -> m 
# vars -> n
# xx_test, yy_test, i_test: the coresponding, out-of-sample data for testing the prediction model

# The weights for the hidden layer are stored in a_all=Vector{Vector{Float64}}, 
# and for output layer at a_layer1(nerons+1)
